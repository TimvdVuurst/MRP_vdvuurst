**Codebase for Master Research Project (MRP) by Tim van der Vuurst (2025-2026)**

This code is used to investigate the velocity distributions of haloes in the FLAMINGO simulation and therefore assumes access to that data. 
There are two main components: one halo and two halo, which is to say motions within a halo and between two haloes respectively. Details on this can be read in the thesis this code was made for: **not yet made** or 
in the thesis this code and thesis was based on: [Sowmya Parthasarathy's Master Thesis](Sowmya/Thesis_Sowmya.pdf).
