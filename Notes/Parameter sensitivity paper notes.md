**Parameter sensitivity paper notes**



*Was already pretty far in when I decided to take notes.*





The pairwise velocities are calculated via direct counting on a subset of 1% of the DM particles - subset bc of efficiency and that it has been shown to be accurate enough. 







They use 2 semi-analytical + 2 emulator approaches in order to get the matter-power spectrum for use in the theoretical eq



They then use 4 actual DM sims with 5 realizations each to compute the actual v12 statistic.



They make sure the power spectrum generators use the same cosmology as the DMO sim for comparison.







They only look at relatively small scale (<~ 50 Mpc)







DMO -> no tracer bias correction needed and even then it's difficult
