TO DO:

- Sowmya's code opschonen en generaliseren
- Meer papers lezen over:
	- RSD modelling
	- FOG & Kaiser effect
	- (Skim) Flamingo paper
	- GF review
	- Tinker 2007
	- Streaming model papers
	
- Kies een beginpunt voor verder onderzoek en ga er mee bezig:
	- 1halo dependence op massa
	- MCMC fitting op 1halo model
	- Better definition of velocities (2halo)
	- How to go from vel. distribution to z-space (zie Jims thesis, this is more mathy, prob for ~the end of the project)
	- Starting with some general improvements of the 2halo model


MORE SPECIFIC:

- In TWOHALO:
	- Plotting is now part of the class. This is actually not a good idea, since you either have to run the entire catalogue first 
      just to plot, or you need to specify every time if you want to run the catalogue or not. Solution: make different plotting file.
	  Since you have to read in the data from the catalogue either way, it does not really matter. The class can still retain its 
	  plotting capability since it could be useful for tests later on, but make sure that any changes are made in both the plotting file and 
	  these functions.
	- Think of a better naming structure for the catalogue files (and by extension the plots). Maybe Marcel has a good idea. 
	- Are we going to keep the mass in the catalogue, feel like this is just bloat.
